# Education Sector EDA

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Engineering Education sector in Maharashtra**.  
It is a **mixed academic, internship, and portfolio project** conducted during my internship at **Clustor Computing**.

The goal of this project is to **analyze, clean, visualize, and interpret education-related data** to understand trends in engineering colleges, universities, student intake, and related parameters using **Python and Power BI**.

---

## Project Objectives
- Collect education sector data from multiple sources
- Clean and preprocess raw datasets
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Extract meaningful features and patterns
- Create visualizations and dashboards for insights
- Present findings in a structured and understandable format

---

## Data Sources
- Government education portals (e.g. data.gov.in)
- University and college websites
- AICTE / MSBTE related sources
- Publicly available education datasets

(Data used is non-confidential and for academic analysis purposes.)

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Power BI**
- **Excel**
- **Git & GitHub**

## Project Workflow
1. Project planning and scope definition  
2. Data collection from multiple sources  
3. Data cleaning (missing values, duplicates, standardization)  
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
5. Feature extraction and correlation analysis  
6. Data visualization using Python  
7. Dashboard creation using Power BI  
8. Documentation and presentation
