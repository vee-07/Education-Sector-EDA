# Education Sector EDA

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Engineering Education sector in Maharashtra**.  
It is a **mixed academic, internship, and portfolio project** conducted during my internship at **Clustor Computing**.

The goal of this project is to **analyze, clean, visualize, and interpret education-related data** to understand trends in engineering colleges, universities, student intake, and related parameters using **Python and Power BI**.
